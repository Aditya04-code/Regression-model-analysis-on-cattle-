Regression Model analysis on cattles 
<p>
As we have come across various research and articles that mention how the
cattle’s lactation efficiency has gone down due to inefficient nutrients in their
diet and also how different states are unable to produce milk from their cattles in
expected amount. This problem is giving rise to supply of chemicals and vaccines
for producing milk due to improper analysis of the cattle’s lactation cycle and the
dry periods of their milk production stages.

We have collected the various datasets and worked upon it with efficient Regression Models
to analyse the lactation period in cattles and also the State-wise efficiency in milk produced
from cattles.This analysis will help us to represent a clear picture of how much nutrients is
required in different lactation periods to give the best possible output.

The cattle’s lactation cycle also affects the weight of the cattle. As the lactation cycle is
generally divided into 4 states namely – Early Lactation, Mid-Lactation, Late Lactation and
Dry Period. In the Early Lactation period, the body reserves are used for milk production, in
the Mid-Lactation period the weight generally remains constant, in the Late Lactation period
the body reserves are regained for the next lactation cycle and the Dry period consists of
rumen rehabilitation.

The cattle-wise analysis of these periods is necessary as these periods affect the weight and
health of cattles differently on the basis of nutrients requirements of different cattles and also
the state-wise analysis is necessary as it will provide a trend in cattle’s expected amount of
milk in different climates.

This project was an attempt to solve the above mentioned problems and to present a clear
representation through efficient Regression model and the same is presented through this
report.
